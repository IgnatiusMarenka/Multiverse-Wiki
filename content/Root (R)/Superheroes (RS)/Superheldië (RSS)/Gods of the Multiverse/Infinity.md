### Backstory
Infinity has many stories which are conceived about how he came into existence. One of the theories is that the people from "[[The Creator (R-00)]]" created him from their fantasy. Another theory says that Infinity is the creator of everything. These stories tell of the legendary god Infinity as being a [[phoenix]] who resurrects every time he dies.
The most common story is that Infinity created the first universe [[RSS-0001]] when he was born. He watched over the planet and soon discovered that he should let the creatures in this universe choose what they want to do but because he didn't want to leave all this potential go to waste, he decided to make a multiverse with universes splitting up as creatures make choices.
After a while Infinity got lonely and decided to create other gods to help him to manage all the universes. He gave every god a part of his powers. One of the gods was [[Legacy]] goddess of true love, before Infinity knew it, he fell in love with her. After a lot of time Infinity was curious about what life was like in his first universe and decided to reincarnate as a Superheldian. His human form [[Ignatius]] was then taken and by now he already took his godly form again. 
After the final battle against [[The Origin]], [[Ignatius]] passed the role of Infinity to another [[Infinity-Relative]] to spend his days with his family.
