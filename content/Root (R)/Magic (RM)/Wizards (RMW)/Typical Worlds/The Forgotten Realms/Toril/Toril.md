Toril was the third planet from [[The Sun]] in [[Realmspace]]. It was orbited by one moon named [[Sel没ne]], and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the [[Tears of Sel没ne]].

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as [[Abeir-Toril]]. The name "Abeir-Toril" was archaic, meaning "cradle of life" in an extinct and forgotten language. Since the [[Spellplague]] and the revelation of the existence of a planetary sibling known as [[Abeir]], and the fact that both Abeir and Toril were once united, the latter name came to informally mean the former united worlds of Abeir and Toril.

## Geography
Toril was comparable in size to the planet [[Earth]], with an equatorial circumference of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers). Its polar circumference was slightly smaller, at approximately 24,900 miles (40,100 kilometers).

Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including [[Faer没n]], [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]] in the central supercontinent and, throughout most of its history [[Anchorome]], [[Maztica]], and [[Katashaka]] in the western region of the world. There was also one large and very mysterious continent east of Kara-Tur called [[Osse]] whose nature and inhabitants were all but unknown.

Following the Spellplague, however, Maztica was sent to Abeir, the sibling world of Toril, and a new continent, [[Laerakond]], appeared in the west. Maztica returned to Toril during the [[Second Sundering]].

### Continents
- [[Faer没n]]: The westernmost portion of Toril's central supercontinent, a diverse landscape inhabited by numerous races and cultures, including [[humans]], [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[elves]], [[halflings]], and [[gnomes]].
- [[Zakhara]]: A mostly hot, arid realm dominated by elemental forces and a philosophy of [[Fate]] and Honor.
- [[Kara-Tur]]: The east, steeped in ancient history.
- [[Maztica]]: Primitive cultures bound by duty to their gods gave blood sacrifices in return for power while those who disagreed with the practice struggled to survive.
- [[Anchorome]]: Hardly explored, seemingly populated with violent elves and more of the humans found in Maztica.
- [[Katashaka]]: South of Maztica. Unexplored.
- [[Laerakond]]: A continent formerly located in the world of Abeir, a land of [[dragon]] empires and "new" cultures.
- [[Osse]]: Populated by spiritualists and [[druids]], the spirit world and nature dominated the lives of its inhabitants. Unexplored.

## History
The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after [[Ao]] sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the [[Tearfall]], splitting it into two twin planets, Abeir and Toril.
