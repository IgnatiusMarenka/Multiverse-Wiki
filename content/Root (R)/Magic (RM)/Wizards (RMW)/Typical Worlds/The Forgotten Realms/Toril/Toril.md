Toril was the third planet from [[The Sun]] in [[Realmspace]]. It was orbited by one moon named [[Selûne]], and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the [[Tears of Selûne]].

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as [[Abeir-Toril]]. The name "Abeir-Toril" was archaic, meaning "cradle of life" in an extinct and forgotten language. Since the [[Spellplague]] and the revelation of the existence of a planetary sibling known as [[Abeir]], and the fact that both Abeir and Toril were once united, the latter name came to informally mean the former united worlds of Abeir and Toril.

## Geography
Toril was comparable in size to the planet [[Earth]], with an equatorial circumference of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers). Its polar circumference was slightly smaller, at approximately 24,900 miles (40,100 kilometers).

Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including [[Faerûn]], [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]] in the central supercontinent and, throughout most of its history [[Anchorome]], [[Maztica]], and [[Katashaka]] in the western region of the world. There was also one large and very mysterious continent east of Kara-Tur called [[Osse]] whose nature and inhabitants were all but unknown.

Following the Spellplague, however, Maztica was sent to Abeir, the sibling world of Toril, and a new continent, [[Laerakond]], appeared in the west. Maztica returned to Toril during the [[Second Sundering]].

### Continents
- [[Faerûn]]: The westernmost portion of Toril's central supercontinent, a diverse landscape inhabited by numerous races and cultures, including [[Human|humans]], [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[elves]], [[halflings]], and [[gnomes]].
- [[Zakhara]]: A mostly hot, arid realm dominated by elemental forces and a philosophy of [[Fate]] and Honor.
- [[Kara-Tur]]: The east, steeped in ancient history.
- [[Maztica]]: Primitive cultures bound by duty to their gods gave blood sacrifices in return for power while those who disagreed with the practice struggled to survive.
- [[Anchorome]]: Hardly explored, seemingly populated with violent elves and more of the humans found in Maztica.
- [[Katashaka]]: South of Maztica. Unexplored.
- [[Laerakond]]: A continent formerly located in the world of Abeir, a land of [[dragon]] empires and "new" cultures.
- [[Osse]]: Populated by spiritualists and [[druids]], the spirit world and nature dominated the lives of its inhabitants. Unexplored.

## History
The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after [[Ao]] sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the [[Tearfall]], splitting it into two twin planets, Abeir and Toril.

### The Dawn Ages

>Main article: [[Dawn Age]]
>See also: [[Time of Dragons]]

The **Dawn age** was a period lasting from [[-30,000 DR]] to [[-24,000 DR]], after the powerful empires of the [[Creator races]] disappeared from the face of Toril and their land was occupied by [[dragons]] and [[giants]]. Constant war for land in [[Faerûn]] led to the creation of great kingdoms and empires.

### The First Flowering

>Main article: [[First Flowering]]

The **First Flowering** was a period in Faerûn's history between [[-24,000 DR]] and [[-12,000 DR]]. At the start of this period, the [[elves]] had split into five major realms: [[Aryvandaar]], [[Illefarn]], [[Keltormir]], [[Miyeritar]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], as well as several smaller ones such as [[Eiellûr]], [[Ilythiir]], [[Orishaar]], [[Syòrpiir]] and [[Thearnytaar]].

It was during this time when the elves cast a [[ritual]] known as the [[Sundering]] to create the [[Isle of Evermeet]], that also resulted in widespread disaster which destroyed or altered much of the world.

### The Founding Time

>Main article: [[The Founding Time]]

**The Founding Time** was the period when the [[humanoid]] civilizations began to rise, in a time when the many dragons and giants were long overthrown and the [[elf wars]] no longer loomed over everyone as a threat.

### The Age of Humanity

>Main article: [[Age of Humanity]]

The **Age of Humanity** was the period from about [[-3000 DR]] to [[1358 DR]]. This period began with the decline of the elven and [[dwarven]] empires and the flourishing and expansion of the [[human]] empires around the world.

### The Present Age

> Main article: [[Present Age]]
> See also: [[Era of Upheaval]]

The **Present Age** was the time period that started in the year [[1000 DR]] and continues  to the present. It was considered one of the most tumultuous ages in the history of Toril. It was a time of constant struggle but also a time of discovery and exploration.

It included such calamitous events like the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the [[Spellplague]] of [[1358 DR]], and the [[Second Sundering]] of the decade of the [[1480s DR]].
