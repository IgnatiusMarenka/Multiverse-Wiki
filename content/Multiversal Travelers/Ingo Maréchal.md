### Backstory
Ingo was born on the first of November in the year 2002 in a hospital in Aalst. He lived with his mother for a big part of his life. In 2010 Ingo met a person called [[Kjente Van Eyken]] a person that would change his live forever. Together with Kjente, Ingo invented the Superheroes Club, later known as [[Teraci]]. Along Ingo's life he met a lot of people that decided to join the Superheroes Club and so they grew. This concept sparked an idea with Ingo who loved reading books, not long after the startup of the Superheroes club, Ingo started writing books about a group of people who traveled to [[Supercity]], a little town in the middle of [[Superheldia]], the land of superheroes. Ingo took this fantasy and started expanding. At the age of eleven Ingo went to High School, where he was bullied for the first time. Ingo had a lot of fantasy, that was for sure and at that time he was a huge fan of magic and Harry Potter. People started calling him wizard and made fun of him, also because of his length, Ingo was quickly called a dinosaur because of the big steps he took when he ran. The bullying stopped around third grade and Ingo had created a thick layer against the bullies. At Ingo's last year on his high school, he made a lot of friends. Even some former bullies became good friends in the end, while some still tried to hurt him. One of his former bullies wanted to write a nickname on his sweater being Wizard of Waverly, by now Ingo had taken peace with people calling him Wizard and he kind off liked it now. But it was that one former bully that caused the name Wizard to become a important term in Ingo's fantasy because it was that one word that caused a new Era in Superheldia the Era of [[Wizard]] the superhero name of [[Ignatius]]. It was then that it became his superhero name in the first place. The years passed by and Ingo developed the term Multiverse in his stories, and it still is wildly used in all of his fantasy.
