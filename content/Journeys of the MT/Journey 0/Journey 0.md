# The beginning
This one shot is meant for new members and fighters of the S.A.C. it will be played by every member of the Secret Agent Company and will be sort of a training for new Agents.

> You all are standing in a big room, you just got pulled through a portal, a thing you thought didn't exist.
> So you are standing in a big hall with the sunlight shining through the tall glass windows and can clearly see each other. The hall is easily 10 meter in height and 10 meter wide. Before you, on a small stage is a good looking guy. He is probably around 1m75 and is in his thirties.
> Karel: "Dear people, you probably are all wondering how you got up here? But answers will be here soon."
> Karel leaves and you are all left behind with only your thoughts.

This is when you teach your players a bit of roleplaying, the core element of TTRPG, it is in the name after all. Let them discuss, and if needed you let Ingo be a character who joins in on the fun, take this time to explain everything that has to do with talking and after a while introduce rolling.

> You are all chatting and starting to know each other when a tall figure walks into the room. He walks through the middle of the group onto the stage. And then he just stands there watching to something in the distance.

This is where your players receive their first DnD Character sheet.
